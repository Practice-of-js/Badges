# JavaScript Practice Project

This project is designed as a practice exercise to strengthen your understanding and skills in JavaScript. The goal is to work on core JavaScript concepts such as functions, conditionals, event handling, and DOM manipulation.

## Features:
- **Interactive UI:** Users can interact with the interface, and the JavaScript will handle dynamic behavior.
- **Score Tracking:** Scores or other metrics are tracked and updated based on user actions.
- **Reset Functionality:** A button to restart the game or process, resetting all values to their initial state.

## Purpose:
The primary objective of this project is to practice:
- Writing functions for core JavaScript logic
- Using conditionals and loops for control flow
- Manipulating the DOM to reflect changes based on user input
- Working with events, such as button clicks or form submissions

## How to Use:
1. Interact with the elements on the page (e.g., buttons, inputs).
2. The JavaScript responds by updating content or performing specific actions.
3. Use the **Restart** button (if available) to reset the state and start over.

This project is a great way to solidify your JavaScript knowledge and experiment with the language by building simple yet interactive applications.

Feel free to modify and expand the project as you continue to learn JavaScript!
